0x02. Python - Async Comprehension

Python has extensive support for synchronous comprehensions, allowing to produce lists, dicts, and sets with a simple and concise syntax. We propose implementing similar syntactic constructions for the asynchronous code.

To illustrate the readability improvement, consider the following example:

result = []
async for i in aiter():
    if i % 2:
        result.append(i)
With the proposed asynchronous comprehensions syntax, the above code becomes as short as:

result = [i async for i in aiter() if i % 2]
The PEP also makes it possible to use the await expressions in all kinds of comprehensions:

result = [await fun() for fun in funcs]
